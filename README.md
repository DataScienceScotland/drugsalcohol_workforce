# About
This repository contains all the code used to tidy and analyse data, as well as produce outputs, associated with the Scottish Government publication "Scotland's Alcohol and Drugs Workforce: A Compendium of Mixed-Methods Research". The final report and supporting documents can be found here: https://www.gov.scot/publications/scotlands-alcohol-drugs-workforce-compendium-mixed-methods-research/

As the title suggests, the analytical approach employed both qualitative and quantitative methods. A bridging narrative has therefore been added in .Rmd format which outlines the project background and aims and etc, and presents main findings emerging from the research. Underneath that, a folder for each workstream has been created for:

  * The review of skills and qualifications relevant to this workforce;
  * The analysis of the survey results;
  * The estimates of workforce prevalence.

Running this project requires access to restricted datasets, which are not publicly available given data protection and privacy concerns. However, we hope that the code may still be useful.
